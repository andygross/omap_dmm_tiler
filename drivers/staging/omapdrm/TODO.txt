TODO
. check error handling/cleanup paths
. add drm_plane / overlay support
. add video decode/encode support (via syslink3 + codec-engine)
. still some rough edges with flipping.. event back to userspace should
  really come after VSYNC interrupt
. where should we do eviction (detatch_pages())?  We aren't necessarily
  accessing the pages via a GART, so maybe we need some other threshold
  to put a cap on the # of pages that can be pin'd.  (It is mostly only
  of interest in case you have a swap partition/file.. which a lot of
  these devices do not.. but it doesn't hurt for the driver to do the
  right thing anyways.)

Userspace:
. git://github.com/robclark/xf86-video-omap.git

Currently tested on
. OMAP3530 beagleboard
. OMAP4430 pandaboard
. OMAP4460 pandaboard

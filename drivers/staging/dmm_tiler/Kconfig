	  Adds support for the DMM TILER found in OMAP4+ SoCs.  The DMM/Tiler
	  provides the capability to create a physically contiguous address
	  from a set of non-contiguous pages of memory.  It also provides 
          zero cost rotation for 2D mapped buffers for other OMAP hardware 
	  blocks (ISS/DSS).

	  If unsure, say N here.

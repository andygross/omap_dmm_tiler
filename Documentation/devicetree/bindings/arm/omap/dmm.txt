OMAP Dynamic Memory Manager (DMM) bindings

Required properties:
- compatible:	Must be "ti,dmm" for OMAP processors containing DMM block
- reg:		Contains timer register address range (base address and length)
- interrupts:	Contains interrupt information (source, etc) for the DMM IRQ
- ti,hwmods:	Name of the hwmod associated to the counter, which is typically
		"dmm"

Example:

dmm: dmm@4e000000 {
	compatible = "ti,dmm";
	reg = <0x4e000000 0x800>;
	ti,hwmods = "dmm";
};

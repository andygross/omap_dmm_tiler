Texas Instruments Palmas family

The Palmas familly are Integrated Power Management Chips.
These chips are connected to an i2c bus.


Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "ti,palmas";
  For Integrated power-management in the palmas series, twl6035, twl6037,
  tps65913
- interrupts : This i2c device has an IRQ line connected to the main SoC
- interrupt-controller : Since the palmas support several interrupts internally,
  it is considered as an interrupt controller cascaded to the SoC one.
- #interrupt-cells = <1>;
- interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller.

Optional node:
- Child nodes contain in the palmas. The palmas family is made of several
  variants that support a different number of features.
  The child nodes will thus depend of the capability of the variant.
- mux_pad1 if a value is given it will be used for the pad1 mux
- mux_pad2 if a value us given it will be used for the pad2 mux
- power_ctrl if a value is given it will be written to the POWER_CTRL register

    #size-cells = <0>;

	ti,mux_pad1 = <0x00>;
